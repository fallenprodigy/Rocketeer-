        <p>
          As this infamous pandemic took over the world, we adjusted our working
          practices so that our <br />
          employees can be as safe and comfortable as possible. We have a hybrid
          work environment, so you can either work from home or visit our lovely
          office on Sairme Street. If it was up to us, we would love you to see
          us in the office because we think face-to-face communications > Zoom
          meetings. Both on the fun and productivity scales.
