        <h1>Redberry Origins</h1>
        <p>
          You watch “What? Where? When?” Yeah. Our founders used to play it.
          That’s where they got a question about a famous American author and
          screenwriter Ray Bradbury. Albeit, our CEO Gaga Darsalia forgot the
          exact name and he answered Ray Redberry. And at that moment, a name
          for a yet to be born company was inspired - Redberry 😇
